Important FAQ on String & StringBuffer

1. Why SCP concpt is available only for String object but not for StringBuffer
    - Ex. If one person is regular customer to some shop then special privilages given to him but
      if this person is go only once a year or month then special privilages not given to him.
      Thats why SCP is available to String but not for StringBuffer.

2. Why String objects are immutable where as StringBuffer objects are mutable.
    - For String object SCP conecpt is there so reusability same object is there.
      So if any one objectâ€™s value is change then all the references are affected so immutability is required.

    - In StringBuffer for every reference different object is there because reusing same object is no there,
      If we change any StringBuffer object it will not affect other objects because there is no SCP

3. In addition to String objects any other objects are immutable in Java?
    - All wrapper class objects
    - Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Character, Boolean
